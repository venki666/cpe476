    "# 5.1 Least Squares Global Localization\n",
    "\n",
    "Least Squares Positioning is a well-known algorithm for robot localization given a set of known landmarks.\n",
    "Least Squares is akin to solve a system of equations of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z_{m \\times 1} = H_{m \\times n} \\cdot x_{n \\times 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $n$ is the length of the pose, $m$ the number of observations, and $H$ a the matrix that codifies the observation model relating the measurement $z$ with the robot pose $x$. For example, if we are using a pointer to measure the distance to a wall, the element associated with each $z$ in $H$ takes the value 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple concept, nevertheless, has to be modified in order to be used  in real scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pseudo-inverse**. Generally, to solve an equation system, we only need as many equations (or in our case observations, $z$) as variables (in our case components of the state/pose, $x$). In such a case, a direct attempt to this problem exists:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$x = H ^{-1} z$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  So a unique sloition exists if $H$ is invertible, that is, $H$ is a quare matrix with $det(H) \\neq 0$. However, typically there are available more observations than variables. An approach to solve this could be to drop some of the additional equations, but given that $z$ has been affected by some noise, we may use the additional information to try to mitigate such noise. However, by doing that $H$ is no a squared matrix anymore, hence not being invertible. \n",
    "\n",
    "  The solution: we make use of the *pseudo-inverse* of a matrix. This, in contrast to the normal inverse operation, can be used in non-square matrices. This operation will result in the closest possible $\\hat{x}$, i.e. the one where the the error ($e = Hx -z$) is minimal:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$ \\hat x = \\arg\\min_{x} e^Te = [(Hx-z)^T(Hx-z)] = \\arg\\min_x || h(x) -z ||^2$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  which has a close form solution using the pseudoinverse:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\\hat{x} = \\underbrace{(H^T H)^{-1} H^T}_{\\textit{pseudo-inverse }(H^+)} z$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weighted measurements**. In cases where multiple sensors affected by different noise profiles are used, or the robot is using a sensor which varying error (*e.g.* typically radial laser scans are more accurate while measuring distances to close objects), it is interesting to weight the contribution of such measurements while retrieving the robot pose. For example, we are going to consider a sensor whose accuracy drops the further the observed landmark is. Given a *covariance* matrix $Q$ describing the error in the measurements, the equations above are rewritten as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ \\hat x = \\arg\\min_{x} e^T Q^{-1} e = [(Hx-z)^TQ^{-1}(Hx-z)] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "    \\begin{aligned}\n",
    "      &\\hat{x} \\leftarrow (H^T Q^{-1} H)^{-1} H^T Q^{-1} z &\\text{(1. Best estimation)}\\\\ \n",
    "      &\\Sigma_{\\hat{x}} \\leftarrow (H^T Q^{-1} H)^{-1} &\\text{(2. Uncertainty of the estimation)}\\\\\n",
    "    \\end{aligned}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example with three measurements having different uncertainty ($\\sigma_1^2$, $\\sigma_2^2$, $\\sigma_3^2$):\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  e^T Q^{-1} = [e_1 \\; e_2 \\; e_3]\n",
    "  \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma_1^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_2^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sigma_3^2 \\end{bmatrix} \n",
    "  = \\frac{e_1^2}{\\sigma_1^2} + \\frac{e_2^2}{\\sigma_2^2} + \\frac{e_3^2}{\\sigma_3^2}\n",
    "  = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{e_i^2}{\\sigma_i^2}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In this way, the bigger the $\\sigma_i^2$, the smaller its contribution to the pose's computation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Non-linear Least Squares**. Until now we have assumed $\\hat{x}$ can be solved as a simple system of equations, i.e. $H$ is a matrix. Nevertheless, typically observation models are non-linear, that is: $z = h(x)$, so the problem now becomes:\n",
    "\n",

    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  As commented, there is no closed-form solution for the problem, but we can iteratively approximate it using the *Gauss-Newton algorithm*:\n",

    "  \\begin{aligned}\n",
    "      &\\hat{x} \\leftarrow (\\dots)  &\\text{(1. Initial guess)} \\\\\n",
