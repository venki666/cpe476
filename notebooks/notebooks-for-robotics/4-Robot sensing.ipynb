We start with a robot ($R1$) placed at a perflectly known pose $p_1$ in the world frame (no uncertainty at this point), which observes a landmark with a range-bearing (polar) sensor affected by an error characterized with the covarince $W_{1p}$, providing a measurement $z_{1p}$ (In ipolar coordinates). **Our goal is to express the landmark position in the world frame**.\n",

    "4. At this point **we predict and obsevation from $R2$ to the landmark**. That is, using the range-bearing observation model and the information of the landmark position and uncertainty as provided by $R1$, we retrieve $z_{2p}$ expressed in polar coordiantes, as well as its associated uncertainty. \n",
