    "In the previous chapter we studied different methods for localizing a robot equipped with a sensor able to take measurements to a number of landmarks with known positions, that is, the map $m$ of the environment was given before hand. Now we will review a number of techniques addressing the opposite problem: to build a map $m$ of the environment given a set of robot poses $x$ and sensor measurements $z$. \n",
    "\n",
    "There exist different types of maps, being the most used ones:\n",
    "- **Geometric maps**\n",
    "  - ***Landmarks based maps***\n",
    "  - ***Occupancy grid maps***\n",
    "- **Topological maps**\n",
    "- **Semantic maps**\n",

    "Concretely, in the next section we are going to take a look at the Extended Kalman Filter for building landmarks based maps."
